## Comma ok Syntax
The comma ok syntax is a common pattern in Go used to check if operations were successful. It's often used in:

1. Map lookups
```go
value, exists := myMap[key]
```

2. Type assertions
```go
value, ok := interface{}.(type)
```

3. Channel operations
```go
value, open := <-channel
```

## Packages in Go
Packages are Go's way of organizing and reusing code. Key points:

- Every Go program is part of a package
- The `package` statement must be first line of code
- Convention is to name package same as directory
- `main` package is special and defines executable program

### Package Visibility
- Uppercase first letter: exported (public)
- Lowercase first letter: unexported (private)

### Common Package Operations
```go
import "package-name"    // Import a package
import (                 // Import multiple packages
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)
```

### Package Management
- Go modules are the standard way to manage dependencies
- `go.mod` file tracks dependencies
- Use `go get` to download packages
- Use `go mod tidy` to clean up dependencies

## Best Practices
- Keep packages focused and cohesive
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Use meaningful package names
- Document exported items
