    "\n",
    "A **thread** is a separate flow of execution within a program. Each thread runs independently, allowing multiple operations to occur simultaneously within the same application. Every thread has its own task and can execute concurrently with other threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multithreading\n",

    "**Multithreading** is the technique of using multiple threads within a single program or process. This allows for parallel execution of tasks, improving the efficiency and responsiveness of applications.\n",

    "## Advantages of Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Performance:** Tasks can be performed in parallel, making better use of CPU resources.\n",
    "- **Responsiveness:** Applications remain responsive to user input while performing background operations.\n",
    "- **Resource Sharing:** Threads within the same process share resources, making communication easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of Multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complexity:** Writing and debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging.\n",
    "- **Synchronization Issues:** Threads may need to coordinate access to shared resources, leading to potential issues like deadlocks or race conditions.\n",

    "- Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently, improving efficiency.\n",
